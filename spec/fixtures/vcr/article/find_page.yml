        it''s easy to just wipe down the grease trays that cover the burners. The
        grease funnels into a tray that you can pull out of the back by grabbing the
        wooden handle that protrudes from the back of the grill.","notes":"","created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":"50346c3d60de7d1bee00604d","name":"Other

        block on the right and by lifting up the tray on the left, you''ll see the
        tool storage compartment. Both sides also have hooks for tool storage. On
        the top of the grill is a thermometer that reaches 600 degrees. If you''re
        looking to move the grill, keep in mind that though it has solid wheels, it''s
        somewhat heavy to wheel around.\n","notes":"","created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":"50346c3d60de7d1bee00604e","name":"Construction
