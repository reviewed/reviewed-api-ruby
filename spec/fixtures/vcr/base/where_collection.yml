        as it may sound, Miele, a German manufacturer that produces some of the world''s
        top high-end appliances, grabbed our attention by displaying a really unusual
        looking cooker hood fan. Keep in mind that this fan held our attention over
        a full fashion show and assorted chefs cooking small tidbits for patient spectators.
        It''s rather hard to find words that do justice to the \"Miele DA6000 W Cooker
        Hood\":http://www.miele.co.uk/cooker-hoods/wall-cooker-hoods-range/da6000w-327/,
        so we''ll go ahead and quote the elderly woman who happened to be standing
        beside us the first time we saw it descend. Mouths agape, she met our eyes
        and said simply \"Sexy, right?\", then took another bite of her scallion pancake.
        Enough talk, just watch the video; we''ll be here when you get back.\n\n<!--

        halogen bulbs, can be controlled either from the cook top (which you saw in
        the video\u2014yes, the staff member was confused as you might think by our
        fascination with a fan), and can be activated using touch controls that are
        located on the fan itself. The products it happened to be paired with are
        the \"KM 6386 Induction Cooktop\":http://www.miele.co.uk/hobs/induction-hobs-range/km6382-315/,
        and the \"H 5981 BP\":http://www.miele.co.uk/ovens/90cm-ovens-range/h5981bp-190/,
        the largest oven available by Miele on the German market today.\n\nAll of
        these products have been out for a while, so there''s nothing really special
        about them except novelty for the under-exposed. What may interest consumers
        is the connection these particular products have with the company Busch-Jaeger.
        The representative I spoke to said they''ve been operating in America since
        1995 under the company heading \"KNX\":http://www.knx.org/; this company handles
        home automation, everything from lights to electronics. As of four years ago,
        they''ve added Miele to their stable of partner companies, which means you
        can control your applicable home appliances from the comfort of...whatever
        chair you happen to be sitting in, as long as your smart mobile device is
        with you. Seems like those cartoons of futuristic houses that we watched so
        many years ago are one step closer to becoming a reality."},{"id":"506b0bcfbd02862270001270","name":"Use

        the recent article for Slate (<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2012/08/bake_at_350_degrees_oven_temperature_is_uncontrollable_and_we_should_stop_trying_to_micromanage_it_.html\">\"Ignore
        Your Oven Dial\"</a>), Brian Palmer advocates for a return to descriptive
        nomenclature of temperature\u2014slow, moderate, and hot\u2014and vigilant
        cooking in lieu of blindly trusting one''s appliances. \n\nWe enjoyed the
        spirit of the article and agreed with some of its finer points, but we''d
        like to complement those points with some scientific data gathered from our
        growing database of lab-tested ovens.\n\nNon-numerical temperature measurements
        worked in the past, in conjunction with closely monitoring food as it cooked.
        But the argument for verbal re-simplification is not as cut-and-dry as it
        once may have been. Since the invention of the oven thermostat in 1915, temperature
        control has improved considerably, and continues to improve. \n\nAccording
        \"to our data\":http://www.oveninfo.com/how-we-test.htm, which is gathered
        by 10 to 15 sensors inside each oven that we test, taking readings every 5
        seconds, most ovens fluctuate by \u00b120\u00b0F throughout a cooking cycle,
        a 40\u00b0 range total, or about \u00b16% at 350\u00b0F\u2014consistent with
        the figures in the Slate article. \n\n<r:content:image  name=''Oven_Temperature_Variance.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nBut the story doesn''t end there. Standard on many new ovens, the convection
        fan\u2019s innovation and increasingly common use has created a sort of paradigm
        shift. By moving the oven\u2019s hot air, the convection fan delivers even
        temperatures and better heat transfer to food, saving time and energy. Besides
        limiting oven hot spots, many convection ovens perform exceptionally well
        in our variance tests, demonstrating incredible abilities to regulate temperature
        over time. \n\nFor example, a \"Samsung oven we just tested\":http://www.oveninfo.com/content/Samsung-FE710DRS-XXA-Flex-Duo-Electric-Oven-Review/Oven-Performance.htm#secondaryovenperformance
        (around $1,300) exhibited a range of 11\u00b0F instead of the typical range
        of 40\u00b0F\u2014that''s closer to \u00b11.5%. Innovation is not dead in
        home appliances.\n\nSure, even the best ovens aren''t totally precise, and
        the slow-moderate-hot system probably works fine for most recipes, which usually
        cook at standard temperatures like 350\u00b0F or 425\u00b0F. But when we have
        actual numbers to work with, it''s silly to use vague, verbal stand-ins. In
        the J.L. Borges short story <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funes_the_Memorious\n\">\u201cFunes
        the Memorious,\u201d</a> an alternative counting system is conceived where
        numbers are assigned their own unique name instead of their base-ten value.
        The verbal substitutes turn out to be useless. How much hotter is slow than
        moderate? Why bother with words when numbers are more effective?\n\nThen there
        are recipes that actually benefit from the typical \u00b16% (or better) precision.
        Cooking is chemistry, and efficient culinary reactions often require specific
        temperatures. Cakes can look nice and crisp on the outside, but will stay
        soggy on the inside. The same goes for roasts. Bread proofing, which makes
        bread rise before cooking, needs to be right around 100\u00b0F. If the temperature
        varies too much, the yeast dies, and you''re left with a flat, dense loaf.
        \n\nMany bakers can even tell whether refrigerated or room-temperature butter
        was used in a certain batch; temperature precision is important to them, to
        say the least. As temperature control improves in the future, chefs could
        take advantage of the even, accurate heat to develop cuisine that was once
        impossible to create. \n\nThe Slate article also took issue with preheating,
        calling it \u201cplain terrible advice.\u201d We disagree. When an oven hits
        130\u00b0F, it begins to cook the edges of its contents, but not the center.
        According to our tests, it takes an average oven about 10 minutes to hit 350\u00b0F
        (right in line with conventional wisdom, for what it''s worth), so there''s
        a significant time period where the oven cooks only the edges. It might look
        done on the outside, but the inside might still be raw. \n\n<r:content:image  name=''GE-JGB600SETSS-primary-350F-ramp.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nCooking a frozen pizza without preheating can be a disaster, too. If
        you''re really unlucky, the pizza will thaw quickly without cooking, and parts
        of it can slip through the grate onto the heating elements below. Burnt cheese
        is not easy to clean. Talk about a hot mess. \"Some chefs also say\":http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/01/baking-for-beginners-an-introduction-to-temperature/69555/
        that dishes like cookies can melt before they cook, effectively ruining the
        batch.\n\nWe also commonly see a phenomenon in our preheating and temperature
        variance tests (see image above), where ovens overshoot the target temperature
        significantly (albeit briefly) before settling into a rhythm of allowable
        fluctuation. For sensitive recipes, the extra heat can cause problems. \n\nLuckily,
        there''s a simple way to avoid these problems: Follow tradition, plan 10 or
        12 minutes ahead, and just preheat the oven.\n\nThe necessity of exactness
        is ultimately up to individual users. Surely many people experience diminishing
        returns for a new or expensive oven, as various features, precision, and accuracy
        might not be used or required. While we heartily agree with the suggestion
        to always monitor food and not blindly trust your oven, we think it''s silly
        to totally ignore your dial\u2014just take it with a grain of salt. We hope
        that we have fully baked the matter."},{"id":"506b0bcebd0286227000125a","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0bcebd0286227000125b","name":"Alternate

        hard to believe that lobster\u2014now a staple among monocle-wearing dressage
        enthusiasts\u2014was once considered \u201cfood for the poor.\u201d Even before
        it entered the diet of slaves, prisoners, and indentured servants in the early
        19th century, lobster meat was used as little more than fertilizer and fish
        bait. And it\u2019s not difficult to imagine why: Lobsters are essentially
        giant red bugs with claws. I mean, gross, right?\n\nEventually, people of
        all classes began to realize how delicious lobster meat really is, and even
        the most la-di-da patrician overlords took kindly to the little critters,
        thereby driving up the cost.\n\n<r:content:image  name=''Fotolia_38105198_XS.jpg''

        />\n\nBut this summer has seen a major dip in the price of old _Homarus americanus_,
        especially along the east coast thanks to an unseasonably warm winter. So
        to celebrate the newfound availability of this storied crustacean we decided
        to answer some of your most pressing, sleep-depriving questions about lobster.\n\nBut
        first, a caveat: We realize that everyone has an opinion about the best way
        to cook lobster, so if you\u2019re looking for a \u201chow-to\u201d guide,
        go watch Gordon Ramsay. We\u2019re not chefs, we\u2019re appliance experts.
        This is a practical guide for prepping, cooking, and storing lobster with
        an average set of home appliances.\n\nh4. Prep\n\n*\u2022 Should I refrigerate
        live lobsters? If so, how?*\n\nIt depends on the amount of time between purchase
        and cooking. If this window is more than an hour or so, it\u2019s fine to
        just leave them in the bag. Otherwise throw them in your refrigerator. But
        even then, you don\u2019t want to wait much more than a day to cook them (two
        days max), as lobsters rarely survive more than 48 hours outside of water,
        depending on how damp their environs (shellfish decompose quickly once dead).\n\nAnd
        hark: Never submerge your lobsters in fresh water if you want to keep them
        alive! This will kill them. Seeing as most people do not have a temperature-controlled
        salt water tank in their kitchen, it\u2019s best to throw a few damp paper
        towels in the bag with the lobsters (for moisture), and then place the bags
        securely in the fridge. Your refrigerator\u2019s humidity setting is also
        important; the greater the dial, the fresher the lobster.\n\n*\u2022 What\u2019s
        the best way to kill a lobster? Is there any mercy?*\n\nNo mercy for the weak!
        Just kidding. Some experts claim lobsters die within seconds of being submerged
        in boiling water (but oh how terrible those few seconds), and others claim
        they\u2019re nervous system is too primitive to allow for very much pain.
        \n\nThe debate is ongoing and best summed up by David Foster Wallace \"in
        this essay\":http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2004/08/consider_the_lobster,
        but if you\u2019re still squeamish about the horrid reality of boiling a living
        thing alive, you can slice a butcher\u2019s knife cleanly and quickly into
        its head, cutting vertically along the length of the lobster right through
        to the cutting board (right behind its eyes). \n\nOther folks talk about temporarily
        freezing the lobster prior to boil (thus freezing its nervous system), or
        lulling it to sleep through desensitization in a pot of gradually heating
        cold water. Really, it\u2019s up to and your own sense of karma and the balance
        of life or whatever.\n\nh4. Cooking\n\n*\u2022 Is boiling on a range the best
        way to cook lobster? What about grilling and steaming?*\n\nMost people prefer
        to boil lobsters alive because they\u2019re sadistic freaks who enjoy watching
        small things suffer in the service of their appetites. Just kidding. Lobsters
        don\u2019t have feelings. Or do they?\n\nNot everyone agrees that boiling
        is the best way to cook lobster, although it is probably the easiest, provided
        you\u2019re able to quell that nagging sense of empathy. Some lobster aficionados,
        for example, swear by steaming. This would require boiling only a couple inches
        of water, adding salt, throwing the bugs in, covering the pot, and letting
        it sit for 15-20 minutes. Advocates of this method argue that it retains the
        flavor, though we can\u2019t speak for the level of mercy provided to the
        lobster.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s grilling. Once again, though, this involves
        first killing the lobsters in boiling water, because you don\u2019t want the
        little buggers crawling around in your grill. Any grill type should do (though
        we hope you\u2019re smart enough to realize a George Foreman is out of the
        question), but some folks prefer the smoky flavor of charcoal. It\u2019s up
        to you.\n\nh4. Cleanup\n\n*\u2022 How should I prepare leftover lobster meat?*\n\nIf
        you have whole uneaten bugs leftover after you eat, shuck them and store the
        meat in an airtight container in your fridge. Meat goes bad quicker when it''s
        left in the shell. But there\u2019s still plenty you can do with the extras:
        salads, bisques, and risottos are all game, as is simply grilling or pan-frying
        the meat. Please, though, for the sake of the lobster and the agony it experienced
        to satiate your palate, don\u2019t cook it in a microwave.\n\n<r:content:image  name=''Fotolia_4406891_XS.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nAs for duration, we don''t recommend waiting more than three days to
        eat it. You should be able to smell rotten meat, but don\u2019t rely on smell
        alone. Keeping it on ice may also help prolong its shelf life.\n\n*\u2022
        Lobsters are a mess. Can the shells be composted?*\n\nYes! As mentioned above,
        Native Americans used lobsters as a fertilizer for crops. The shells are rich
        in calcium and chitin\u2014a fiber found in exoskeletons and fungal cell walls.
        These minerals are great for young gardens and composting material, and for
        taking comfort in the circle of life after viciously boiling an innocent creature
        alive.\n\n*\u2022 Will I meet all the lobsters I kill in the afterlife?*\n\nYes!
        And they will be 58 times larger than they were in this life, so bring your
        super-sized crackers\u2014lobsters are notoriously unforgiving. Shamans hold
        that if you sensuously pet the little critter while playing \"Chopin\u2019s

        of gas and electric, seamlessly working together, and chances are a hybrid
        car will come to mind. If you''re planning to remodel your kitchen, however,
        you might want to consider another kind of hybrid.\n\nDual-fuel ranges combine
        an electric oven with a natural gas or propane-powered range top in a single
        package. Once only available at the highest end of the home appliance market,
        they''re becoming increasingly popular with home chefs who want the even heat
        of an electric oven without sacrificing the precision control of a gas burner.\n\n<r:content:image  name=''kenmore_dual_fuel.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nh4. Why Dual Fuel?\n\nSerious bakers prefer the precision of an \"electric
        oven\":http://www.oveninfo.com/Electric.htm; the best electric stoves stay
        within ten degrees of the selected temperature, which ensures even and thorough
        cooking, and keeps food from drying out or burning. But serious cooks appreciate
        the infinitely adjustable flame and versatility of a \"gas range top\":http://www.oveninfo.com/Gas.htm.
        Since serious bakers and serious cooks are often the same person, the market
        for a dual-fuel range is pretty obvious.\n\nh4. Is Dual Fuel Worth It?\n\nOnly
        if you''re willing to shell out some serious cash. Originally, only high-end
        manufacturers like Wolf and Viking sold dual-fuel ranges, mainly to homeowners,
        usually in huge sizes (36 inches or larger) with prices that matched the sticker
        on a serviceable used car. \n\nNow, hundreds of manufacturers have joined
        in. Their dual-fuel models are still expensive, but not as jaw-droppingly
        so as in the past. We found a \"Frigidaire Gallery FGDS3065KF\":http://www.oveninfo.com/specs/Frigidaire/FGDS3065KF/16025.htm
        30-inch range on sale for just over $1500, with similar offerings from GE,
        KitchenAid and Bosch ringing up at just a few hundred dollars more.\n\nThat''s
        only the first part of the cost, however. After you''ve shelled out a few
        grand for a new range, you''ll likely be faced with some hefty bills from
        plumbers and/or electricians. Chances are, a kitchen equipped for a gas stove
        isn''t wired for the 220 volt electrical outlet that an electric oven requires,
        and an all-electric kitchen isn''t plumbed for gas. In some cases, installing
        the missing fuel may add an additional thousand dollars to the cost of your
        stove.\n\nh4. Are There Cheaper Options?\n\nIf that doesn''t fit your renovation
        budget, make the most of your existing gas or electric range with a few simple
        tips. If you''re finding that pots and pans aren''t heating evenly on an electric
        range, try getting new cookware. That 10-piece set you got for your wedding
        will probably warp a bit by your 10th anniversary, which means you''ll get
        dead spots wherever the pan fails to contact the electric burner. Bakers who
        loathe the imprecise temperature control of their gas ovens can use baking
        stones to keep the temperature consistent, and refrain from opening the oven
        door until that cake is finished.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to how
        much you\u2019re willing and able to spend versus how much you love precision
        temperature control. The most persnickety at-home chefs will demand a dual
        fuel range, but budget-conscious homeowners can get by with some more resourceful
        techniques for regulating heat."},{"id":"506b0bcdbd02862270001230","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0bcdbd02862270001231","name":"Alternate

        announced their new \"White Ice\":http://www.refrigeratorinfo.com/News/So-Long-Stainless-Whirlpool-Introduces-a-New-Finish-For-Premium-Kitchens.htm
        finish for their deluxe kitchen appliance collection. The white, mirrored-glass,
        silver-accented design is notable because for the first time in at least a
        decade, the exterior of a major-brand, top-end appliance line _isn''t_ strictly
        stainless steel. \n\nThere have been other hints that the industry is shifting
        away from a solely stainless design plan, like \"these colorful ranges\":http://www.ajmadison.com/b.php/Heartland%3BFreestanding%3BRanges/N~25+4294965548+4294962657.
        To be fair, they''ve mostly come from less-familiar European brands and niche
        manufacturers. (Though Whirlpool''s own Amana line did introduce a \"floral
        refrigerator finish\":http://www.refrigeratorinfo.com/content/A8RXNGMWG-17-6-cu-ft-Top-Freezer-Refrigerator.htm
        back in 2009. We''re still waiting for it to revolutionize interior design
        tastes.)\n\n<r:content:image  name=''whirlpool-whiteice.jpg'' size=''original''  class=''
        center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true'' />\n\nBut even with new finishes
        available, is stainless still king? It isn''t going anywhere anytime soon.
        Almost all of \"the ovens that we''ve reviewed on OvenInfo.com\":http://www.oveninfo.com/Latest-Oven-Reviews-and-News.htm
        are predominately stainless. Almost all of the upcoming major-brand premium
        kitchen lines will still be stainless. Stainless is cheap to make, relatively
        easy to clean, and has become the standard for kitchen design\u2014sensibilities
        don''t change overnight. \n\n<r:content:image  name=''Samsung-FX710BGS-vanity.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nWhite Ice and other colorful finishes do seem to represent a shift in
        the way that we think about interior design: We''re doing it to please ourselves
        and create comfortable living spaces _right now_, rather than designing to
        boost resale value. Younger homeowners in particular seem to prefer the extra
        choices.\n\nSo what do you think? How long will stainless maintain its reign?
        Is color a passing fad? Does anybody really want an iOven to match their iPad?
        Aren''t they just tools for cooking and cleaning anyway? What colors will
        our robot maids come in?"},{"id":"506b0bccbd0286227000121b","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0bccbd0286227000121c","name":"Alternate

        <r:product:name /> is the most inexpensive oven we''ve reviewed thus far,
        as well as being the only range with electric coils we''ve put through our
        testing gauntlet. While it doesn''t have the stainless look of the elite kitchen,
        it''s a classic, utilitarian machine meant to be used, not to be posed. In
        effect, it is a sort of people''s oven.\n\nAs far as the utilitarian aspect
        goes, the rangetop impressed us greatly, exhibiting some of the best results
        we''ve ever seen: speedy boiling, McQueen-cool simmer temperatures, and McEnroe-hot
        searing temperatures across _every element_. The only performance disadvantage
        we can think of is the fact the rangetop stays hot for a while after shutoff
        and the temperature doesn''t adjust as fast as a gas rangetop does, nor can
        you control it precisely, as you lack the visual feedback from a flame. Besides
        performance disadvantages, the other main issue with the coils is cleaning
        them, which is a most unenjoyable experience.\n\nThe oven performance wasn''t
        particularly impressive, but it wasn''t remarkably unimpressive either. It
        exhibited the kind of temperature variance that we see in many ovens three
        times its price, but did manage to average the target temperatures, even if
        it strayed (not all ovens do this). Additionally, the fantastic preheat time
        of just eight and a half minutes was a plus.\n\nThe major downside of this
        oven is the lack of features. The main absence from this oven is a convection
        fan, which would provide more even even cooking as well as more cooking efficiency.
        Other little features, such as a griddle, will likely not matter to someone
        interested in this oven. After all, if you''re looking into this oven, you''re
        probably doing so because you don''t want to spend $1,000 if you don''t need
        to. To that, we can say that if you don''t need the looks of the features,
        we think this would be a solid choice."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0bcbbd028622700011e3","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Whirlpool-WFC310S0AW-Freestanding-Electric-Range-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0bcbbd028622700011e5","name":"Features

        On sale at $1,750 (MSRP $2,000), the pricetag seems to promise quite a lot.
        Does it deliver?\n\nWell, the promise is fulfilled in some ways: the stainless
        finish (apparently requisite in all modern kitchen design), the commendable
        performance by the rangetop, the surplus of features, and the acceptable conventional
        oven. However, we found some serious problems with the lower oven in convection
        mode: notably the incredibly long preheating time and utter disregard for
        the target temperature. As most people consider the temperature setting an
        injunction rather than a suggestion, this performance may be a dealbreaker
        for some, as the second oven''s functionality is called into question with
        the shoddy performance. And as convection ovens become more popular due to
        their superior performance and efficiency, many people might look elsewhere.\n\nAll
        in all, we found this oven to be a bit expensive for what it can do, but it
        would certainly be a decent buy for those who don''t use convection cooking."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0bbebd028622700010e9","name":"Design","summary":"Some

        the fact that it has two of them. Bakers and roasters alike will appreciate
        the vast capacity of the 2.5 cubic foot and 4.2 cubic foot upper oven, offering
        a 6.7 combined cubic feet, programmable at two temperatures or the same one.
        The lower oven boasts an \"EasyConvect\" convection system. Unfortunately,
        we found this mode to be far inferior to the upper oven''s conventional performance.
        This is too bad, as convection ovens that work properly can cut necessary
        temperature, cook time, and provide more even heat.\n\nAdditional features
        include sturdy oven racks--one of which rolls out providing especially easy
        access to the food--and a slow-cook setting that has low temperatures allowing
        for four, eight, and twelve hour sauna session for food that takes its time.

        /> comes with two ovens, five burners, and a character as flawed as Harry
        Callahan. \n\nUnder the smooth ceramic top, the rangetop elements performed
        quite well. Often we see all of the power placed on one boiler, but here we
        found three well-powered elements, and even the simmering burner could boil
        pretty fast. The elements'' heat range was excellent as well, with equally
        good simmering and searing abilities.\n\nDown below, we were less satisfied.
        The upper conventional oven performed fine--although it was a was a little
        odd at 350\u00b0F--but the lower convection oven did not impress. Lacking
        a fast preheat, accuracy to the target temperature, or precision of temperature,
        our tests of this oven make it simply seem unusable. Even if this lower oven
        was adequate, we''d probably consider this a few hundred dollars too expensive.
        \n\nSince we expect someone in the market for a dual oven range to want to
        use the features they''ve bought, we hesitate to recommend this range, as
        the convection oven was so impotent. Convection cooking has so many advantages,
        and it seems silly to shell out for something that wouldn''t necessarily be
        used. Sure, this range might work if you know you the convection oven will
        never be touched--though we might advocate waiting for the price to drop more.
        But if you even think you might want to convect, move on."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0bc4bd0286227000114b","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"KitchenAid-KERS505XSS-Freestanding-Range-Double-Electric-Oven-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0bc4bd0286227000114d","name":"Features

        temperature showed a marked inability to use its thermostat, raising the internal

        /> offers quite a lot--oven space, rangetop elements, and features. Although
        not without flaws, this oven may be a good choice, depending on the user.\n\nThe
        rangetop showed excellent temperature range, with excellent simmering and
        searing abilities. The various extra features such as the bridge element,
        the keep warm zone, and the \"Speed Heat\" boiling element make this rangetop
        attractive. The only downside the range has besides overheating slightly was
        the middling boiling scores. While the lack of blue flame makes it difficult
        to adjust temperature as precisely as a gas rangetop, these electric elements
        demonstrate the electric advantage with its wide temperature range.\n\nIn
        the caverns below, we found a similarly mixed bag tilted towards the good.
        We were thoroughly impressed by the spectacular preheat time, but at the same
        time the found the oven lacked adequate temperature control when used as a
        conventional oven. Especially, considering that only the bottom oven has convection--which
        controlled temperature quite well--this might be a single oven range in practice.
        While some food can handle the intense fluctuation, anyone requiring two ovens--serious
        bakers for instance--will most likely prefer a single high-performance oven
        instead. Oven-wise, this may be quantity rather than quality. \n\nDespite
        its shortcomings, this oven might be a good value, as it is indeed a decent
        two oven range for well under $1,500. But before buying, we do recommend thoroughly
        make sure this is the oven for you by closely comparing this review to your

        had the roof cut off by Cousin Joey with a Sawzall, and slapped with a higher

        some nice qualities, such as a very consistent convection oven and just sprints
        to the target temperature, limiting preheat time. We also liked the oval burner
        that can accommodate long stoveware or a griddle. Besides the existence of
        this burner, the rangetop is underpowered and under-performs, even with similar

        /> didn''t end up impressing us a whole lot despite its elegant stainless
        steel finish with black trim. With an MSRP of $1,199--we found it for $1,049
        on sale--we think you might get better performance for your dollar with different
        oven.\n\nThe <r:product:model /> really impressed us with how fast it preheated
        to 350\u00b0F, surging to its target in less than seven minutes. We also approved
        of the oven''s convection setting with its minimal fluctuation compared to
        the conventional mode, also looking solid next to its competitors. The added
        fifth oval burner will be a useful addition for many griddle enthusiasts,
        and we like how all the burners were recessed under the continuous grating.
        \n\nBut none of this really makes up for the ovens lackluster performance.
        When Kenmore put those extra BTUs into the center oval burner, they must have
        taken them away from the other four, as the rangetop proved underpowered.
        While the front right burner boiled six cups of water in under five minutes,
        the second most powerful burner (a backburner?!) took over twice as long.
        People looking for high temperature cooking performance won''t be happy either,
        as the burners didn''t get our our sensors hot enough for the kind of searing
        and browning capabilities we look for. The non-convection mode on the oven
        didn''t impress us either, as it exhibited just a bit too much fluctuation.\n\nAll
        in all, the <r:product:name /> doesn''t seem like a great value, as other
        ovens have tested way better in its price range. Don''t get us wrong though,
        if you''re a casual chef and this matches your kitchen, it''ll work."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0bb4bd0286227000101b","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Kenmore-72903-Stainless-Steel-Gas-Range-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0bb4bd0286227000101d","name":"Features

        being beautiful, the <r:product:name /> is an excellent performer. Exhibiting
        <r:product:brand:name />''s sleek, ruthlessly efficient Euro look, this single
        electric convection oven impressed us by maintaining very consistent temperatures
        on all temperature settings, as well as the ability to boil water quickly
        on its big twelve inch element, the 0-60mph test for range tops.\n\nHowever,
        the oven''s other high-powered burner wasn''t particularly impressive, with
        its \"powerboil\" setting losing the race to the boil to its the non-\"powerboil\"
        brother. While the <r:product:name /> is a solid performer, it may lack some
        of the features expected from an oven in this price range ($1199 MSRP, $1079
        on sale). This oven is manufactured by Frigidaire, who makes their own less

        be a bit too fierce, at 400 watts higher than the what the manufacturer had
        stated. As it''s a fire hazard to run a burner over 650\u00b0F, we recommend
        only running the burner on \"HI\" to heat up a cold element, if at all. Temperatures
        that hot are above the flashpoints for oils, and no one wants a flare up.
        It might even be a good idea to place a piece of heat tape on the knob locking
        out the upper end of this burner or putting up a warning sign for irregular
        users, even though that might spoil that efficient Euro look. Cooking wise,
        all of this means that even on a medium setting, this burner should be plenty
        hot enough to sear and brown. On the plus side however, the high maximum temperature
        means that the burner is strong enough to be operating far from the edge of
        its capabilities in normal use, just like those BMW and Mercedes sports cars.
        So while a Porsche may be able to go twice the speed limit, and a Bosch can

        should readers buy it or not. ","body":"The <r:product:name /> proves to be
        a high performance machine, but doesn''t have all the features one might expect
        for the price (MSRP $1199, on sale $1079). But if you''re interested in getting
        an oven to match the European <r:product:brand:name /> look in your kitchen,
        this one is certainly more than eye candy.\n\nPerformance wise, we were impressed
        more by the oven, which exhibited a quick heat up with excellent temperature
        consistency, acceptable temperature range, and featured a convection setting
        as well as an adjustable broiler. Serious bakers will be certainly pleased
        at this oven''s performance if they don''t require a second oven. The range
        was a decent performer quickly boiling water and maintaining a good simmer,
        but it lacked some features, such as a bridge burner and we only liked one
        of the front, high-powered burners. As for the features it does have, the
        dangerously-hot-but-the-unimpressive ''powerboil'' burner setting and the
        100W warming element seem to function like a German car''s cup holders--they
        exist so they can be listed on the fact sheet, but are not particularly useful.
        \n\nFor the 100W warming element, one might as well leave food on the right
        rear burner, leaving it being warmed at a 117\u00b0F that won''t burn your
        food. Similarly, while one could use the front left \"powerboil\" feature
        to boil water quickly, one might as well use the impressive front right burner
        that can boil water twice as fast.\n\nIn conclusion, the <r:product:model
        /> would be a solid choice someone looking to complete a suite of Euro-styled
        appliances, offering excellent performance for the features it does have.
        But if you aren''t dying to have that efficient and cultured Euro look, a
        very similar oven is made by Frigidaire, who incidentally makes this one as
        well for <r:product:brand:name />."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0badbd02862270000f83","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Bosch-HES5053U-Electric-Freestanding-Range-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0badbd02862270000f85","name":"Features

        will only read this page and not click down for more details. ","body":"The
        <r:product:name /> excels at almost everything it does, but it lacks a few
        features that one might expect from a $1,000 oven. For a similar price, other
        ovens might have a bridge burner, a second oven, an oval burner on which to
        place a griddle, or even an actual griddle. On the plus side, it does have
        the convection feature, more efficiently distributing heat for shorter cook
        times and lower temperatures for similar results. It also has two burners
        with dual elements to accommodate different sizes of stoveware. However, some
        of the other features it does have are probably less useful than advertised,
        such as the \"powerboil\" and the warming burner. But what this oven lacks
        most in features is other solid burners in supporting roles besides that big
        twelve inch fella that performs so well.\n\n"}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0badbd02862270000f88","name":"Specs

        of the stainless steel style, but it lacks the chops we''d like to see in
        something this expensive. \n\nIt''s not a model without some pros; we found
        the quick preheat times impressive, and didn''t have too much criticism for
        the conventional oven temperature variance. But we did see weakness almost
        everywhere else: the underpowered rangetop, the abject convection oven, the
        convoluted control panel, and the chill the oven seemed to be running.\n\nSince
        many other ranges that we''ve tested have cost less and performed better,

        should readers buy it or not. ","body":"For a $1959 hunk of stainless steel
        (MSRP $2159), you get a whole lot: two ovens, five burners, and a boatload
        of features. But after looking at the performance test results, the <r:product:name
        /> may not be such a good value after all, especially in comparison to some
        of the other ovens we''ve tested.\n\nOn the plus side, you''ve got the rolling
        rack, the oval griddle burner, the extra oven, the string of convection settings,
        speedy broiler, and quick preheating time. Many of these features and normal
        oven functions work well, or well enough. But it''s hard to get away from
        the fact that the rangetop and oven had some issues. These issues, such as
        the convection oven''s lack of temperature control, or underpowered rangetop
        might be tolerable in an oven half the price, but for two thousand dollars
        we expect high performance, and imagine our readers do as well. Naturally,
        if you use two ovens frequently without the convection setting and don''t
        need high performance from the rangetop, this might satisfy your needs. This
        oven clearly stresses features over performance, which is silly because many
        of those features are dependent on good performance, such as the convection
        oven. It''s probable that someone who doesn''t care about the performance
        might not take advantage of the features anyway.\n\nIf you''re buying this
        oven, you better know exactly why you''re buying it."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0ba5bd02862270000eeb","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"KitchenAid-KGRS505XSS-Freestanding-Range-Double-Gas-Oven-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0ba5bd02862270000eed","name":"Features

        after the Vikings and the Wolfs, the <r:product:name /> offers that high-end
        stainless look of a very serious kitchen. Not surprisingly, <r:product:brand:name
        /> has priced it accordingly at a staggering MSRP of $4700--although we found
        it on sale for $3900. Fortunately, if you decide to pull the trigger on this
        hot commodity, you''ll get excellent performance, as good as this dual-fuel
        oven''s looks.\n\nThe dual-fuel hybrid identity may be the main selling point
        for this oven, as owners benefit from both the consistency of the electric
        oven as well as the precision and instant adjustment of gas burners. While
        the rangetop may not have those extra features expected in such an expensive
        range (bridge burner, griddle, warming burner, etc.), it had three excellent
        quick-boiling power burners, over the usual one or two. Unfortunately, the
        performance will come with a decent gas bill. Down below, the convection-capable
        oven performed quite well in our tests, delivering consistent heat with short
        preheating periods, and more features than anyone will ever need.\n\nThe oven''s
        major downside is the awkwardly placed control panel, which further irritated
        us by being a bit convoluted. So while you adjust it from a squat (it''s perpendicular
        to the ground, not angled up), you''ll stay down for a bit while you figure
        it out. \n\nWhile we recognize the very diminished returns that come with
        spending three times more than a people''s oven, this is an impressive oven
        to own, if you can afford it."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0b98bd02862270000df1","name":"Design","summary":"A

        dual-fuel range from Whirlpool''s high-end appliance division. Dual-fuel ranges
        have a gas cooktop and an electric oven, which many professional chefs and
        cooking enthusiasts prefer for the best of both worlds when it comes to even
        temperature control. The range itself has no built-in backsplash, so you may
        need to do some kitchen renovations if there''s nothing behind your old range.
        Otherwise, it feels quite substantial, with thick stainless sides and top,
        knurled handles and controls and massive cooking grates that might as well
        have been stolen from a sewer system. Beneath the burners is an easy-to-clean
        porcelain enamel surface. It''s not as shiny as stainless, but it''s a lot
        easier to get splatters off.\n\nUnlike the offerings of some of Jenn-Air''s
        competitors, the <r:product:model /> apes a professional range in all ways
        but one: It''s got a big, color LCD touch screen on its front. Though some
        users may find it intuitive and easy-to-use, we''re sure that others shopping
        in this segment would like the simplest controls possible.\n\nOur two major
        complaints are about height. First, the oven itself is very low to the ground,
        since there''s no tall warming drawer. Second, we''re not fans of the location
        of the electronic control panel, which is about at waist height. That means
        you''ll find yourself bowing down like Celine Dion after a show in Vegas every
        time you use the oven. "},{"id":"506b0b98bd02862270000e03","name":"unnamed

        and exhibited a range of temperatures, something that most broilers can''t
        do.\n\nThe gas powered rangetop performed decently, boiling water six liters
        of water in about 23 minutes (105 seconds per fluid ounce) on the powerful
        front left burner. While this may not be as impressive as some of the other
        ovens we have reviewed, it is important to note that Jenn-Air has put three

        and three perfunctory burners, which we often see. However, the runty rear

        burner for boiling (for pasta for instance), other ranges can accomplish this
        cheaper and quicker. Although one should never try to boil anything with the

        course, the utility of the features will depend entirely on the user.\n\nThe
        main oven feature is its dual convection fans, which provide a flow of hot
        air to achieve similar results of heat transfer at temperatures 25\u00b0F
        lower, saving energy and time, if you elect not to lower the temperature (this
        only works with certain foods.) There are a m\u00e9lange of variations: convection
        pastry, convection roast, convection slow roast, convection pizza, and convection
        broil, which all probably have their niche uses, the simple \"convection bake\"
        option is the one that is most likely to be used with any sort of regularity.
        With all the hardware all installed, it was evidently simple to simply program
        the oven to do the rest. There is a useful automatic convection conversion
        option, which automatically adjusts for the increased heat transfer of the
        convection process, and allows the user to input the conventional oven temperature.
        Typically, the temperature is lowered 25\u00b0F. Additionally, there are bread
        proof and \"rapid\" bread proof settings, which keep temperatures of 100\u00b0F
        and 200\u00b0F respectively to facilitate the yeast reactions for those baking
        bread. Curiously, the \"keep warm\" setting also delivers 200\u00b0F. Their
        differences are unclear.\n\nBesides the various oven settings, there is a
        built in temperature probe, which will put the oven into \"Keep Warm\" mode
        when the food reaches the desired temperature.\n\nAs far as the timer goes,
        one can set a timer for the oven to turn off, or simply use the timer as a

        pros. 3) Describe the cons. 4) Offer the final recommendation: should readers
        buy it or not. ","body":"The question of our recommending the <r:product:name
        /> is a tricky one. We want to recommend it due to its fantastic performance
        in our tests, but it''s hard to endorse such an expensive product when there
        are others that can do the job as well for less. So, we''ll just say that
        it may not be right for everyone. But for $3,900 ($4,700 MSRP), this oven
        is quite the cooking machine for a kitchen.\n\nWhile the boiling times on
        the rangetop weren''t the fastest we''ve ever seen, we commend the overall
        performance, as three of the four burners are fantastic power burners with
        solid boiling times. This is something we don''t always see, and busy cooks
        will appreciate the added flexibility on the stovetop. The impressive electric
        oven''s consistent temperatures and short preheat times reminded us why people
        choose electric ovens combined with precision that gas provides with the instant
        visual and thermal feedback of blue flames. \n\nWhile the very basic rangetop''s
        main feature is simply three power burners, the oven has a medley of features
        that most people might not use on a regular basis. One can control all of
        these things on the very annoying touchscreen, which is perpendicular to the
        floor. So prepare to squat to adjust the oven, and to stay squatting for a
        while, as you figure out what''s going on. We just hope this oven-computer
        doesn''t freeze in an attack of sweet irony. In the event that it does, maybe
        the hot steel box that it is mounted on will un-freeze it.\n\nThe bottom line
        for this <r:product:name /> comes down to whether one''s budget allows for
        this kind of conspicuous consumption. But we can assure you that if it does,
        you will have one hot oven that gets the job done well."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0b9ebd02862270000e53","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Jenn-Air-JDRP430W-Dual-Fuel-Oven-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0b9ebd02862270000e55","name":"Features

        heaping on a ton of extra options. This rangetop''s main feature is simply
        four well-performing burners.\n\nOn the other hand, the electric oven is chock-loaded

        fan, but both circulate hot air in the same way. Heating the lower cavity
        to 350\u00b0F took just over seven minutes, faster than heating up the entire
        oven. For baking smaller things, this seems like a good proposition, allowing
        for shorter preheat times with less oven to heat. Preheating the top cavity
        to 450\u00b0F took just nine minutes, so this seems like a potentially useful
        and time-saving feature. Unfortunately, accessing one cavity requires opening
        the door to both, but this seems a small disadvantage to the option. Both

        less useful--are just as unusual. The control panel has an \"Easy Cook\" feature,
        which allows the user to choose from the preset options of pizza, casserole,
        chicken nuggets, and cake. Besides being slightly offensive to American cuisine,
        these do not appear to be particularly useful, especially when most of these
        recipes call for a single oven temperature. Besides the \"Easy Cook\" options,
        there are \"Custom Cook\" options that allow the user to save temperature
        settings. The three racks and seven rack settings allow for exceptional flexibility
        in conjunction with the Flex Duo divider, and with the various convection
        settings delivering even heat around the oven, the need to swap racks to prevent
        overcooking may be minimized."},{"id":"506b0b93bd02862270000d9d","name":"Other

        a gimmick, marketing itself as an cooking instrument of compromise between
        dual oven and single oven systems. In many cases, something this ambitious
        might have resulted in that corollary that often follows multifunction products
        of compromise: jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nIn this case, the Flex
        Duo breaks that paradigm. As a single oven, with the divider safely secured
        in the storage/warming drawer, the <r:product:model /> shows incredible temperature
        consistency in addition to the fast preheat. With the divider in place, the
        smaller cavities heat up even more quickly, and we found the temperature regulation
        quite impressive. There are no compromises in the oven.\n\nThe range, while
        less praiseworthy, performed well in our tests, quickly boiling water on all
        of its burners, even the back burners designed more for simmering. Unfortunately,
        the power of the front left burner leaves us a little nervous, but regardless
        of how excessive the temperature might be, no one should be leaving a stove
        unattended.\n\nBesides the overloaded front burner, we only found a few pockmarks
        on this machine''s report card. When the oven preheats, it often blows past
        its target temperature and past the normal upper bound of variance. So while
        the preheat times are short, it might be a good idea to let the oven simmer
        down for a minute or two longer to let it get into its rhythm. Additionally,
        if you''re someone who frequently uses the broiler and expects a lot from
        the oven''s hottest element, this may disappoint. While the it''s probably
        good enough for most people''s needs, its slow heat-up times might make you
        think twice.\n\nIn spite of these hiccups, we recommend this oven as a fine
        compromise for people who want the flexibility of size and multiple ovens,
        without sacrificing performance. If it''s in your price range, we expect it
        to satisfy."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0b96bd02862270000dbb","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Samsung-FE710DRS-XXA-Flex-Duo-Electric-Oven-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0b96bd02862270000dbd","name":"Features

        to find high-end features without breaking the bank (MSRP $1100, on sale for
        $990). Heck, it even has that stainless steel finish everyone''s been jonesing

        broiler, and they''re selected by pressing either the 1, 2 or 3 buttons on
        the numeric keypad, but that''s not immediately apparent. For convection broiling,
        just key in a temperature.\n"},{"id":"506b0b8cbd02862270000d0e","name":"Timer","notes":"Discuss

        how easy it is to clean the oven, including cleaning modes. ","body":"Cleaning
        is where this range differs from most of the rest. Instead of a pyrolitic
        self-cleaning cycle, which superheats the oven to such a high temperature
        that all spills turn to charcoal, the <r:product:name /> is one of the first
        ranges to offer AquaLift. \n\nAs you might expect from its name, AquaLift
        uses water to steam-clean the inside of the range. Though it requires the
        user to pour in two cups of water and wipe down the inside of the range when
        the cycle is finished, it also only takes 40 minutes to clean, doesn''t reach
        any super-high temperatures and doesn''t emit any of those odors that are
        common to pyrolitic self clean cycles.\n\nAquaLift is a bit of a tradeoff.
        You have to use it more often and put in a little more labor than with a pyrolitic
        clean, but it doesn''t have any of the drawbacks of the \"scorched earth\"
        self-cleaning method. If you''ve never used the self-clean option on your
        range because you don''t like how it smells or how hot it gets, you may want
        to try AquaLift.\n\nUp top, the <r:product:name /> has a Schott Ceran glass
        cooktop that requires special care. You must use a special nonabrasive cleaner,
        and you can''t spill any sugar on it as it may permanently damage the cooktop.\n"},{"id":"506b0b8cbd02862270000d10","name":"Additional

        $1,094), the <r:product:name /> offers a glut of features on this electric
        range, encased in stainless steel. After throwing it into our testing process,
        we developed a complex opinion about this oven, but all in all saw it in a
        favorable light. \n\nTo the rangetop''s credit, solid boiling results from
        _all_ the burners were married to similarly stellar temperature range, searing
        and simmering with the best of them. We thought the features were useful,
        and were pleased to see they didn''t detract from the performance. We found
        we liked the interesting, unconventional setup of the \"Power Center Electric
        Cooktop,\" especially since it didn''t sacrifice performance. One thing we''d
        have liked to see was one element that could really boil quickly, although
        the average boiling time for all the elements was phenomenal.\n\nAside from
        all the oven''s great features, its capacity, its racks, its cleaning system,
        it was clear that Maytag phoned in their conventional oven, as it produced
        horrible results for consistency and evenness of temperature. However, due
        to the default oven setting being convection, we can tell that Maytag expects
        the most use from that, which we appreciate, since the convection setting
        is quite satisfactory. Maytag subtly steers users toward convection--and away
        from convention--by setting it as the default. This is probably a good idea.
        \n\nThe bottom line for the <r:product:name />? This oven is a fantastic value
        and if you prefer convection cooking, take this home."}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0b8ebd02862270000d23","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Maytag-MER8880AS-Oven-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0b8ebd02862270000d25","name":"Features

        burners and the slow broiler. And we don''t expect that from an expensive
        range like this. \n\nThis underpowered burner lineup does have an upside,
        though: the burners produced a nice low temperature for simmering, and they
        don''t use as much gas as their more powerful cousins. But that''s a poor
        trade off for a product at this price point. \n\n"}],"permissions":{"read":true,"create":false,"update":false,"destroy":false}},{"id":"506b0b80bd02862270000bf3","name":"Features","summary":"Features","slug":"Whirlpool-GGG390LXS-Gas-Range-Review/Features","sections":[{"id":"506b0b80bd02862270000bf5","name":"Features

        of breaking the task of controlling these down. The most complex control is
        for the 3 segment ring on the front right, which is effectively three elements
        in one. This works by breaking the rotation of the control dial into three
        segments, which activate one, two or all three segments. Want to just use
        the center one? Turn it about a third of the way around. Want to use all three?
        Turn it all the way around. This is a good compromise between simplifying
        the control and putting multiple features on one dial, and it works well.\n\nThe

        water quickly and producing a good range of temperatures from the elements
        on the range. They both struggled in the same areas, though, failing to provide
        the range of oven temperatures that we look for, particularly at the lower
        end of the scale, where both produced temperatures that are on the warm side.
        With the two having similar prices (the GE is at $<r:product:spec name=''MSRP''  precision=''0''
        />, the LG costs about $1699), the choice comes down to the features that

        quickly, produced a good range of temperatures from the electric elements
        on the rangetop and produced consistent oven temperatures. It is also easy
        to use: more complex features like the 3-stage front right burner are clearly
        explained by the icons on the control dials, and the layout of the oven &
        broiler controls makes it easy to work out how to set both running. \n\nWe
        were impressed with this range overall, as it offers a good combination of
        performance and features for the price. Some users may be slightly overwhelmed
        by the number of things it can do, but it is easy to use and the features
        perform well. So, if you want to use electricity as your fuel and are looking

        and creating a much higher temperature on the range top (a scorching 796\u00b0F).
        The electric oven also scored slightly higher, producing a wider range of
        temperatures and better consistency. The only area where the gas oven won
        out was the brolier, where the electric broiler failed to heat our test plate

        over 5 minutes. \n\nThe choice of gas Vs electric often comes down to which

        stand out well. Many modern ovens offer a steam clean mode that uses heated
        water, but this model sticks with the use of extreme heat to burn the dirt
        off, which takes longer. One issue that we did notice is the presence of the

        for ovens. And it does offer a good range of features for the price, with
        5 burners (including a large fish burner) and dual ovens. \n\nOn the plus
        side, we found that the gas burners were capable of delivering a good range
        of temperatures, ranging from a very gentle simmer up to a high sear temperature,
        and the controls were easy to use and well laid out. \n\nWe did find, however,
        that the ovens did not share this wide temperature range, with the warming
        temperatures being a little warm, and the highest setting being a little cooler
        than we like to see. These temperatures were also inconstant, with a lot of
        variation across the oven space. Using the convection feature of the bottom
        oven did improve this situation somewhat, but the temperature range was still
        wider than we like to see. \n\nOur overall conclusion is that the <r:product:name
        /> is a good pick for the general cook, but those who are serious about cooking
        may want to look elsewhere. The slightly high keep warm temperature also means
        that those who like to prepare parts of a meal early may want to look elsewhere

        you''re in the midst of a remodeling project or need to furnish your new home,
        it can be tough to find appliances to fit a tight budget. So below, we''ve
        compiled a list of products that offer the best combination of performance
        and savings. Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t top-of-the-line; they\u2019re
        appliances that offer a strong user experience and deliver solid performance
        without giving you a swift kick in the wallet.\n\nh4. Budget Refrigerator:
        Haier RRTW18VABW \n\nLadies and gentlemen, meet the new fridge on the block.
        The \"Haier RRTW18VABW\":http://www.refrigeratorinfo.com/content/Haier-RRTW18VABW-18-2-Cu-Ft-Top-Freezer-White-Review.htm
        is one of the best low-cost fridges that we\u2019ve tested, and it''s made
        right here in the USA. It retails for about $705, but we''ve found it on sale
        for as much as 30 percent off. \n\n<r:content:image  name=''fridge-dishwasher-budg-ru.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nIt reminds us of our days in college dorms and one-room apartments,
        but it\u2019s actually a quality product.  This Haier is very energy efficient,
        has more fridge space than your average entry-level top-freezer, and does
        a great job of keeping vegetables from drying out in the crisper. It\u2019s
        not perfect, though: some temperature discrepancies in the freezer may mean
        your pints of Ben & Jerry\u2019s could develop a small coat of freezer burn,
        and the wire shelves will make cleaning any spills a nightmare. For what it
        costs, though, the Haier RRTW18VABW is quite a steal.\n\nh4. Budget Dishwasher:
        Frigidaire Gallery FGHD2433KF\n\nCombining an attractive stainless exterior
        with high-quality washing performance, the \"Frigidaire Gallery FGHS2433KF\":http://www.dishwashersinfo.com/content/Frigidaire-Gallery-FGHD2433KF-Stainless-Steel-Built-in-Dishwasher-Review.htm
        is a fantastic investment with an MSRP of just $649. It has plenty of storage
        capacity, making it suitable for even larger families. It also has a plethora
        of cycle options including a sanitize feature and a delayed start for folks
        who want to take advantage of late-night electricity rates. \n\nAs far as
        actual performance, the Quick Wash was the only cycle that didn\u2019t live
        up to expectations; as long as you give the toughest stains the attention
        they need, this Frigidaire will take good care of your dishes. The only catch
        is that this Frigidaire doesn\u2019t let you customize its wash cycles, and
        the cycles it does have are longer than most dishwashers'', which could result
        in slightly higher rates of water and electricity consumption. But for a dishwasher
        that performs as well and costs as little as this Frigidaire, those issues
        seem pretty small.\n\nh4. Budget Washer: GE GFWN1100LWW \n\nThe \"GE GFWN1100LWW\":http://www.washerdryerinfo.com/content/GE-GFWN1100LWW.htm
        is one of the best low-cost ($699) washers we\u2019ve tested. We measured
        some excellent performance, and it removed our toughest stains without any
        problems. It\u2019s gentle, too: even the Heavy Duty cycle had a light touch
        when it came to protecting fabrics. It''s water- and energy-efficient as well.\n\nThe
        Delicate cycle was the only really disappointing part, as it left clothes
        soapy and more worn than any washer should. There aren\u2019t many customizable
        settings, so as long as you don\u2019t mind a lack of bells and whistles,
        this washer is a great purchase (just bring your delicates to the dry cleaner).\n\n<r:content:image  name=''ge-washer-dryer-budg-ru.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nh4. Budget Dryer: GE GTDP400EMWS\n\nThe \"GTDP400EMWS\":http://www.washerdryerinfo.com/content/GE-GTDP400EMWS-7-0-Cu-Ft-Electric-Dryer-Review.htm
        looks like something you\u2019d see in the laundry room at your grandparents\u2019
        house and has the customization level of a shoebox, but it does a fantastic
        job at drying clothes. If you don\u2019t have a lot of heat-sensitive garments
        (temperatures got higher than usual for almost every cycle) give this one
        a look. It has an MSRP of just $549.\n\nh4. Budget Oven: GE JGB600SETSS\n\nAnother
        quality budget product in the GE lineup is the \"JGB600SETSS\":http://www.oveninfo.com/content/GE-JGB600SETSS-Gas-Range.htm,
        a 30-inch, freestanding gas-range oven. Ovens tend to be some of the more
        expensive appliances available, so it\u2019s fitting that this is the priciest
        budget item on our list with a standard retail price of $1,099 (though you
        can easily find it online for a few hundred less). \n\nThe stainless finish
        will make almost any kitchen look better, and it has all the basics: five
        burners, a warming tray, and the usual features such as self-cleaning, bake
        and broil options, and a cooking timer. It lacks the extra features found
        on higher-end machines, and heat consistency wasn\u2019t perfectly spot on;
        also, we found that it took a bit longer for water to boil than on other models
        that we\u2019ve tested. As far as actual cooking performance goes, however,
        it did quite well. It may not be the fanciest oven available, but for that
        price tag, it should suit the thrifty remodeler.\n\n<r:content:image  name=''oven-grill-budg-ru.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nh4. Budget Grill: Coleman Roadtrip Grill LX\n\nWhether you have a full
        backyard or a small balcony, cookouts are a summer staple, and there\u2019s
        no better budget grill that we\u2019ve tested than the \"Coleman Roadtrip
        Grill LX\":http://www.grillsinfo.com/content/Coleman-Road-Trip-XL-Review.htm.
        Costing just $220, you\u2019ll have plenty of money left over to buy the best
        beef available. This little gas grill heats up very quickly, with simple controls
        and a reliable lighter. It has a standard grilling area, as well as a griddle
        tray and a stove grate that cooks things just like the burners on your stove.
        \n\nThe drawbacks are few, but some are quite important: the grill handle
        stays nice and cool, but the grill itself can get incredibly hot; you\u2019ll
        want to keep a close eye on things if you\u2019re grilling with children around.
        Also, it\u2019s not the biggest one out there, so if you\u2019re cooking at
        a big family reunion, people may end up eating in shifts. If you\u2019re looking
        for a grill that can feed a small family comfortably, then go for this one:
        it\u2019s compact, cooks quickly, and will save you a bundle.\n"},{"id":"506b0b4bbd028622700007d6","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0b4bbd028622700007d7","name":"Alternate

        there are a number of newly released ovens that use new cooking technology
        to bolster customization and performance.\n\nThe Freestanding Flex Duo Oven
        allows users to switch between a single cavity or two-cavity oven by inserting
        a removable metal plate to divide the two areas. When divided, each cavity
        can cook at a different temperature: cookies and a roast at the same time.\n\n<r:content:image  name=''Samsung-Flex-Duo-prov-400.jpg''
        size=''original''  class='' center alignCenter '' include_caption=''true''
        />\n\nThe idea of dual-range ovens is, of course, nothing new. We tested and
        were impressed with the \"GE Profile PB975STSS\":http://www.oveninfo.com/content/GE-Profile-PB975STSS-Dual-Oven-Electric-Range-Review.htm,
        among others. The key difference with the Flex Duo oven is that the divider
        can be removed, making for a much larger cavity, perfect for Thanksgiving
        turkeys. The GE Profile and others have two cavities of fixed size. \n\nThe
        Samsung Flex Duo retails for $1699. \n"},{"id":"506b0b4abd028622700007c3","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0b4abd028622700007c4","name":"Alternate

        casually grill, this is a solid grill. While the <r:product:name /> decent
        at low-temperature cooking, it sets itself apart from other grills by doing
        very well with high-fire grilling and cooking food quickly. Something to consider

        a lot to like about the <r:product:name />. It''s easy to ignite, has five
        burners, plenty of storage and tool space, and you''ll have no problem moving
        it around. However, its $700 price tag suggests that it should provide top-tier
        performance. We found that while the <r:product:name /> wasn''t the best we''ve
        tested, it cooks food consistently and pretty quickly. You may want to buy
        a pair of gloves when using it for an extended period of time because the
        grill handle gets hotter during usage than what is standard for most grills.

        out how long each patty will take to cook, and score on the speed and consistency
        of the cooking. This grill had only middling performance: we found that the
        pattys arranged on the cooking grate took between 12 and half minutes and
        just over 15 minutes to cook. That''s both a long time and a wide spread of

        some flexibility if you switch to a permanent install and want to power the

        At 31 by 17.75 inches for a total of 550 square inches, it is the biggest
        we''ve seen so far. This certainly gives you plenty of room to cook on, but,
        as our performance tests show, there is more variation in temperature over
        this area than we like to see. The cooking grate is made of stainless steel
        and is in three sections, each of which can be removed individually. \n\nBelow
        the cooking grate are the burner covers that stop the grease falling into
        the burners. Again, these are easy to remove and clean if required. Above
        the cooking grate is a large rotisserie burner, which is 16 inches wide. "},{"id":"506b0b1fbd0286227000036c","name":"Warming

        steel in a single unit, but it is harder to remove than the main grate. However,
        you are less likely to need to remove this grate than the main one, so that

        There is a grease trap under the main grilling area which catches all of the
        falling grease. Some grills use a disposable foil tray, but this one is a
        metal tray that slides out of the back. This is easier to reach than a tray
        located under the grill, but we would recommend covering this in foil rather
        than having to scoop the grease out to clean the tray."},{"id":"506b0b1fbd0286227000036f","name":"Other

        the panel lights are battery powered, while the grilling lights are mains

        would take between just over 9 and 11 minutes to cook. That is pretty fast

        Description","notes":"","body":"Most of the controls are located on the front
        panel, with four large plastic dials for each of the burners. There is no
        separate ignition control: pushing in and turning the dials triggers the lighter.
        You then control the level of gas by rotating the large dial counter-clockwise
        to reduce the gas flow or clockwise to increase it. To turn the gas off, you
        push the dial in and rotate it fully counter-clockwise until it locks into
        place. \n\nThis control system works well: because the dial requires both
        a push and a turn to start the grill, you aren''t going to accidentally trigger
        it when you brush against it, and you are unlikely to change the cooking level
        by accidentally moving the dial while loading the grill. The large dials are
        quite stiff, though; someone with a limited range of motion might find it
        more difficult to control than one with smaller dials that require less force
        to move. \n\nJust above the control dials is an indicator that shows the gas
        level in the canister when you push the button: a useful feature for making
        sure you aren''t going to run out of gas halfway through a cooking session.
        \n\nThe side burner is controlled with a single dial and igniter button. Like
        the burner itself, these controls are located underneath a panel that covers
        the entire burner, so this area can double as a work surface if you aren''t
        using it to cook. These controls are also easy to use, "},{"id":"506b0b11bd0286227000020f","name":"Fuel

        Other grills offer smaller sections to the rack (such as the 4 parts of the
        rack for the Broil King Royal 490) that are easier to handle individually.

        Tray Performance","notes":"","body":"Located above the cooking grate, we found
        that the warming tray was about 14% hotter than the cooking grate when the
        lid was closed. So, it should be easily hot enough to keep your cooked food
        warm after it has been grilled."},{"id":"506b0b14bd02862270000241","name":"Assembly
        Description","notes":"","body":"We found that the <r:product:model /> was
        very quick to put together, taking us just under 25 minutes to go from unboxing
        to being ready to fire up and start grilling.  It ships with the main body
        already assembled and requires only the addition of the side wings and the
        drip assembly underneath the grill that catches the grease. We only found
        one step that was awkward: we needed to find an extra pair of hands to help
        while inserting a screw that holds the drip tray assembly in place, as we
        were unable to hold the cross bar and insert the screw at the same time. However,
        this was easily done with some help, and the only tools required for assembly
        were a screwdriver, a pair of pliers and a spare set of hands."},{"id":"506b0b14bd02862270000242","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0b14bd02862270000243","name":"Summary","notes":"","body":"The

        along the way. At one point, the assembly guide shows that four screws are
        used to attach the grill to the cart that it sits on, but six are actually
        required. If we would have used four, the body of the grill would not have
        been properly attached to the cart. When finally assembled, the doors of the
        grill cabinet were not aligned. Overall, we were not impressed with the assembly
        process or the construction of this grill. "},{"id":"506b0b0fbd028622700001d0","name":"Snippets","notes":"","body":""},{"id":"506b0b0fbd028622700001d1","name":"Summary","notes":"","body":"This

        low fire temperature (325\u00b0F) in just 4 minutes and 20 seconds, and at
        the high fire setting (approx 625\u00b0F) in 8 minutes and 28 seconds. The

        of a grill, we cook several meat patties (6 in total for this grill) for 5
        minutes on each side, and then measure the temperature of the inside of the
        patty. From this temperature, we figure out how long each patty would take
        to cook, and how wide this range of cooking times is. For this grill on the
        low fire, the time to cook ranged from just under 9 minutes for the patty
        in the center of the grill to between 15 and 18 minutes for the ones on the
        outside. Since each burger will be done at a different time, this means more

        of the heating by measuring the temperature just above the cooking grate using
        nine thermocouples. Here we found that, as expected, the temperature was highest
        at the center of the grate, with the temperature towards the edges falling
        by up to 150 degrees. A creative cook could use this temperature range to
        their advantage, but we prefer to see more even temperature. "},{"id":"506b0b08bd02862270000122","name":"Low

        Perhaps more worrying was the temperature of the handle, which rose to 282\u00b0F
        while the charcoal was heating up. Once the charcoal had started to smoulder,
        it fell to around 125\u00b0F, but that is still somewhat hotter than we like
