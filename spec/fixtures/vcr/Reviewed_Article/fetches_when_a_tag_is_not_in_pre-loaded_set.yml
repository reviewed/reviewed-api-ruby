        has been one of the most exciting years yet for the staff here at DigitalCameraInfo.com,
        as the photographic industry put the woes of 2011 behind it to release some
        truly amazing cameras. From flagship DSLRs to incredible compacts, there was
        a seemingly endless parade of superb cameras for us to test in our labs. There
        has also been some incredible innovation in the camera market, with fascinating
        new technology coming to the fore as companies look to branch out in new and
        interesting ways. Out of this diverse and ever-growing market we have culled
        the very best to provide you with our 2012 Best of Year Awards, the cameras
        we would recommend to not only you, but to our friends and families.\n\n{{

        [Canon 1D X](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-1D-X-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $6,799 body-only)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-CANON_1DX.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}While
        there were only a couple high-end cameras brought to market in 2011, this
        year saw the eventual release of some incredible full-frame models from each
        of the major players. With some fantastic mid-range bodies also seeing the
        light of day, the Canon 1D X had stiff competition for our top spot once it
        finally was released to the public. Despite the delay, the 1D X bested all
        comers in our lab tests, producing the highest overall score of the year.
        While it&#39;s certainly too big, too expensive, and simply *too much* for
        most people, the Canon 1D X is, hands-down, the best camera from 2012.  \n\n####
        Runner-up  \n#### [Nikon D4](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon-D4-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n**(MSRP
        $5,999)**\n\nThe Nikon D4 also graced our labs this year, and we found that
        it offered performance that exceeded the 1D X in some areas, falling behind
        in others. We should reserve special mention for the D4&#39;s backlit control
        labels and uncompressed HDMI video output. The D4 is an impressive machine
        that any pro shooting Nikon should be proud to own, but it falls just behind
        the 1D X in our overall scoring.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Canon
        1D X](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-1D-X-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n[Read
        the Full Review of the Nikon D4](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon-D4-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n\n***\n\n###
        Best Innovation  \n#### [Lytro Light Field Camera](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Lytro-Light-Field-Camera-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n**(MSRP
        $499 16GB)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-LYTRO.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}With
        so many new and interesting models hitting the market in 2012, Lytro&#39;s
        light field camera stands apart as truly innovative. While we aren&#39;t as
        impressed with the Lytro&#39;s traditional image quality, the ability to capture
        an entire scene and change the focal point after the fact is unlike anything
        else on the market. The Lytro stands as one of the most innovative cameras
        to come along in years, and we&#39;re very interested to see how this technology
        develops in years to come.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Samsung Galaxy Camera](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Samsung-Galaxy-Camera-EK-GC100-Review.htm)\n**(MSRP
        $499)**\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Camera also deserves a nod here. While the Nikon
        S800c was the first camera to come to market with Android on-board, the Galaxy
        Camera&#39;s use of Android version 4.1 (Jelly Bean) makes it feel far more
        advanced. We expect to see Android integration in cameras to take off over
        the next few years, but the Galaxy Camera already feels like a third-generation
        product rather than a one-off concept.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the

        Best Ultra High-End System Camera\n#### [Canon 1D X](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-1D-X-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $6,799 body-only)**\n  \n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Nikon D4](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon-D4-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $5,999 body-only)**\n  \n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-CANON_1DX.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}It&#39;s
        not every year that Canon and Nikon both release new flagship professional
        DSLRs. The Nikon D4 and Canon 1D X both employ advanced technology in incredible
        ways, integrating not only professional-quality video features, but also cutting-edge
        autofocus, connectivity options, and operational speed. These two cameras
        push the boundaries of what professional DSLRs can do, scoring better than
        any other cameras before them in our testing labs. While we loved the D4&#39;s
        backlit controls and impressive video features, the 1D X ekes out the win
        here (by the slimmest of margins) thanks to its superior shooting speed and
        more versatile autofocus control, helping you get the shot you&#39;re aiming
        for more often.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Canon 1D X](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-1D-X-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n[Read

        Best High-End System Camera  \n#### [Nikon D800](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon-D800-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $2,999 body-only)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-D800.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}In
        a year where we saw nearly 10 new full-frame cameras, none were as much fun
        to shoot with as the Nikon D800. While the speedier Nikon D4 performed better
        in the lab, we found the 36.3-megapixel images from the D800 to be simply
        irresistible[.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrGw_cOgwa8) The ability to
        capture such an immense level of detail was undeniably useful, especially
        in extreme low-light situations.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Canon 5D Mark
        III](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III-Review-Digital-Camera.htm)\n**(MSRP
        $3,499 body-only)**  \n\nThe D800&#39;s closest competition is the Canon 5D
        Mark III. While we found the Mark III to be more useful for serious video
        work, the D800 produced sharper images and offered more baked-in features.
        Those already married to either system will probably want to stick to their
        guns, but the D800 has been our camera of choice since the moment it entered
        our labs.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Nikon D800](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon

        Best Mid-Range System Camera  \n#### [Panasonic DMC-GH3](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Panasonic-Lumix-GH3-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n**(MSRP
        Available for pre-order. $1,299 body-only)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-GH3.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}The
        Panasonic GH3 was a late entrant for our awards, and while we expected its
        class-leading video performance, it surprised us as a brilliant all-around
        photographic tool. With excellent overall image quality, a superb DSLR-style
        grip, oodles of customization options, and access to the ever-growing Micro
        Four Thirds lens ecosystem, the GH3 is an excellent camera for anyone who&#39;s
        looking for a high-end interchangeable lens camera but doesn&#39;t want to
        deal with the bulk or price of a full-frame DSLR.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n####
        [Canon Rebel T4i](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-Rebel-T4i-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n**(MSRP
        $1,149 w/ 18-135mm STM lens)**  \n\nThose looking to spend a little less without
        sacrificing image quality might want to give the Canon Rebel T4i a look. The
        T4i is the first touchscreen-enabled traditional DSLR, and it provides a potent
        mix of handling, still image quality, and video features. If you&#39;re on
        a budget we&#39;d suggest you opt for the cheaper 18-55mm kit, but the 18-135mm
        STM lens provides smoother, quieter autofocus for video recording as well
        as improved optical performance.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Panasonic

        \n\n### Best Compact System Camera  \n#### [Sony NEX-7](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Sony-Alpha-NEX-7-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $1,249 w/ 18-55mm lens)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-SONY_NEX7.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}The
        Sony Alpha NEX-7 was one of the first truly high-end compact system cameras
        to hit the market, with great handling, an articulating LCD, three control
        dials, and built-in electronic viewfinder. The NEX-7&#39;s 24.3-megapixel
        CMOS image sensor is of the same APS-C standard size as you&#39;d find in
        many larger DSLRs, offering superb dynamic range and excellent shot-to-shot
        speeds. While we wish the NEX system had a few more high-quality lenses to
        complement its great cameras, we feel the NEX-7 is the best performing compact
        system camera you can pick up today.  \n  \n#### Runner-up  \n####[Olympus
        OM-D E-M5](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Olympus-OM-D-E-M5-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $1,099 w/ 14-42mm lens)**  \n\nWith all the praise we had for the NEX-7, the
        Olympus OM-D E-M5 still put up a serious fight, sporting an excellent Sony-produced
        sensor and vintage Olympus looks. The E-M5 is one of the more popular cameras
        of 2012, with weather sealing and a level of customization few cameras can
        match. We think it&#39;s a fine option for anyone who wants a little more
        retro flavor&mdash;and access to the Micro Four Thirds ecosystem&mdash;with
        their compact system camera, and we doubt you&#39;ll be disappointed if you
        pick one up.  \n\n[Read the Full Review of the Sony NEX-7](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Sony-Alpha-NEX-7-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n[Read

        Best Enthusiast Camera  \n#### [Fuji X-Pro1](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Fujifilm-X-Pro1-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $1,699 body-only)**\n  \n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Olympus OM-D E-M5](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Olympus-OM-D-E-M5-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n(MSRP
        $1,099 w/ 14-42mm lens)  \n  \n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-XPRO1.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}While
        we found that the Sony NEX-7 provided the best performance of all the compact
        system cameras we tested this year, we still have a place in our hearts for
        cameras that focus as much on the process as the end result. To that end we
        are recognizing the Fuji X-Pro1 as the best enthusiast camera of 2012, designed
        to appeal to those who want a camera whose appeal goes beyond test results
        and comparative analysis. With a small group of absolutely fantastic prime
        lenses, physical dials galore, and a design reminiscent of the finest film
        cameras, the Fuji X-Pro1 is a body aimed squarely at photography phanatics.
        With apologies to the wonderful Olympus OM-D E-M5, we applaud Fuji for giving
        us yet another camera to salivate over in 2012.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review

        Best Point-and-Shoot Camera  \n#### [Nikon P7700](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Nikon-Coolpix-P7700-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $499)**\n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-P7700.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}It&#39;s
        been an ugly year for the bottom end of the point-and-shoot camera market,
        but at the same time the upper tier has flourished. Impressive high-end compacts
        from virtually every major manufacturer passed through our labs this year,
        but we found the Nikon P7700 outdid them all. With a 7x optical zoom, fully
        articulating screen, hot shoe, and plenty of physical controls on a body with
        superb handling characteristics, the $500 Nikon P7700 is the best point-and-shoot
        we tested this year.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Sony RX100](http://digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Sony-Cyber-shot-RX100-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $649)**      \n\nThe Sony RX100 is a close second, however, with a larger
        sensor and a slightly brighter lens. The result of that combination is excellent
        low-light capabilities and attractively blurred backgrounds. While the P7700
        outperformed the RX100 in the lab, shots from Sony&#39;s flagship compact
        have an aesthetic quality that no other camera in its class can match. On
        the other hand, we were less impressed with its characterless handling and
        newbie-oriented user interface. Its high price is a concern, too.  \n  \n[Read

        Sony RX100 has long been the favorite for this award, but leave it to Nikon
        to come and spoil Sony&#39;s fun at the very last minute. While the RX100
        enjoys some undeniable benefits in bokeh and low-light capability thanks to
        its outsized 1-inch sensor, the Nikon P7700 outperformed it in our image quality
        tests in virtually every other category. Its complement of high-end features
        will make it of particular interest to advanced amateurs and prosumers, and
        it&#39;s got a fantastic grip, too. We still love the RX100, but the P7700

        PowerShots have long been the go-to recommendation for anyone looking for
        an inexpensive, simple camera that offers decent image quality. The 110 HS
        carries that torch well, with a 3-inch rear LCD, 5x optical zoom, and a size
        and shape that can easily slip into all but the tightest pockets. With smartphones
        getting better and better, there&#39;s not much room left for cameras like
        this, but if you want higher-resolution photos or an optical zoom at a low
        price, the 110 HS is a great option.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Canon

        $479)**  \n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY2-SX50HS.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}The
        Canon PowerShot SX50 HS takes home our super-zoom award this year thanks to
        its combination of solid design, excellent ease-of-use, and great overall
        image quality. Of course, it&#39;s hard to argue with the SX50&#39;s credentials
        when it sports a ridiculous 50x optical zoom. The SX50 HS is more than a one-trick
        pony, though, as it performed well enough to take the top prize over some
        serious competition from both Panasonic and Sony.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n####
        [Panasonic FZ200](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Panasonic-Lumix-FZ200-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $599)**\n\nThe Panasonic FZ200 is the runner-up here, largely due to its excellent
        24x zoom lens. The FZ200 is unique in the super-zoom market in that its lens
        maintains a wide f/2.8 aperture all the way through its optical zoom range.
        The Canon SX50 did better in the labs and offers nearly double the zoom range,
        but the FZ200&#39;s aperture is more than twice as wide at full zoom, helping
        keep motion blur under control.  \n\n[Read the Full Review of the Canon PowerShot

        also takes home our award for best travel zoom of the year with the SX260
        HS. Its combination of a solid 20x optical zoom and a sleek, stylish, compact
        design will probably check all the boxes for many casual users. If you need
        a big zoom range in a camera that will easily slip into a jacket pocket, the
        SX260 HS is our unqualified recommendation. A close second, however, is the
        Sony HX30V. The HX30V falls behind the SX260 HS in overall performance, but
        it offers superior video capture capability, which will be a big deal to some
        users.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Canon PowerShot SX260 HS](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-PowerShot-SX260-HS-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n[Read

        we had an award for &quot;camera that the staff fought to play with the most,&quot;
        the Sony RX100 would easily take it home. The camera&#39;s combination of
        a large sensor and excellent lens produced the closest thing to DSLR image
        quality in a pocketable camera that we&#39;ve seen thus far. While it was
        still beat out by the Nikon P7700 in our lab tests, the RX100 is quite a bit
        smaller and is absolutely the best camera you can (probably) fit in your pants
        pocket.  \n  \n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Canon PowerShot S110](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-PowerShot-S110-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP

        been big fans of Canon&#39;s diminutive S series since it kickstarted the
        trend of tiny yet high-end compact point-and-shoot cameras a couple years
        back. We&#39;re excited to see what Canon does with the S-series going forward,
        though we&#39;re hoping for a little more innovation in future models.  \n  \n[Read

        addition, the TG-1 can go to depths of 40 feet and is rated to withstand dust,
        cold, and even drops of up to 6.6 feet. Those credentials easily earn it the

        $229)**  \n\n{{callout}}{{article.attachments[''DCI-BOY-WB150F.jpg'']}}{{/callout}}Just
        because the budget point-and-shoot category hasn&#39;t seen much love in 2012
        doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t still find bargains. With a street price that
        frequently drops below $200, the WB150F offers image quality on par with more
        expensive cameras. A smart design, solid handling, and built-in Wi-Fi gave
        us plenty to like about this camera. There are cheaper options available,
        to be sure, but this is one of the best cost-to-value propositions on the
        market today.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Sony NEX-F3](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Sony-Alpha-NEX-F3-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)  \n**(MSRP

        entry-level model in Sony&#39;s NEX line, the NEX-F3. Like the NEX-C3 before
        it, the F3 perfoms as well as cameras that cost north of $1000 for a price
        of right around $600 (with a kit lens included). Getting that kind of quality
        for such a low price is practically unheard of, which makes the NEX-F3 a perfect
        introduction to interchangeable lens cameras for those on a tight budget.  \n  \n[Read

        Panasonic GH3 is only available for pre-order at the moment, but we&#39;ve
        already put one to test in our labs. The result? It&#39;s the best stills
        camera for shooting video, period. With a built-in mic port, improved video
        quality, an incredible number of compression options, and a pre-order price
        of around $1300, the GH3 can take on the best video-friendly full-frame bodies
        and come out victorious. When you consider that its closest competition&mdash;the
        Canon 5D Mark III&mdash;is bigger, heavier, offers less features, and costs
        $3500 for the body alone, you&#39;ll understand why we&#39;re so impressed
        with the Panasonic GH3.  \n\n#### Runner-up  \n#### [Canon 5D Mark III](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III-Review-Digital-Camera.htm)  \n**(MSRP
        $3,499 body-only)**    \n\nThere is certainly room for the Mark III in the
        market, though, especially if you&#39;re looking for a camera that is equally
        adept at still photography. But let us reassure you: This decision isn&#39;t
        a matter of choosing value over quality&mdash;the Panasonic GH3 simply produces
        better video. Its late-season arrival may be a problem if you&#39;re planning
        on giving one as a gift this December, but we assure you that it&#39;s worth
        the wait.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3](http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Panasonic-Lumix-GH3-Digital-Camera-Review.htm)\n[Read

        some fantastic and fantastically expensive video cameras have come through
        our labs this year, we understand that not everyone is willing to shell out
        several thousand dollars for high-end video capability. Those looking for
        solid video from a budget-friendly system camera should look no further than
        the Canon Rebel T4i. The T4i captures appealing full HD video, has full manual
        control, and sports nearly silent continuous autofocus while recording clips.
        At a body-only price of just $799.99, we think the T4i is a great option for
        those who want quality stills and HD video in one cheap package.  \n\n####

        capable of recording excellent video, but the NEX-5R offers the best value
        of the bunch. Like the Canon T4i, the NEX-5R handles autofocus very well,
        and, although the camera doesn&rsquo;t have a fully rotatable LCD, it does
        have a screen that tilts up and down to accommodate various shooting angles.
        In terms of performance, the NEX-5R basically matched the Canon T4i in our
        video tests, but we gave the Canon an edge in handling thanks to its better
        grip and easier access to video controls.  \n  \n[Read the Full Review of

        most people&#39;s minds immediately turn to DSLRs when they think about cameras

        an honorable mention to Sony&#39;s line of 1080/60p compact cameras, the Panasonic
        FZ200 takes top honors here. The FZ200 offers more control, an incredible
        24X constant-aperture zoom lens, and superior ergonomics to help steady your

        on its point-and-shoot cameras either. Deciding on this runner-up award came
        down to a judgment call between three Sony models: the RX100, the HX200V,
        or the HX30V&mdash;all of which did a good job in our video tests, ranking
        in just behind the Panasonic FZ200. We ended up choosing the HX30V because
        of its design, figuring that it is small enough to fit in your pocket, but
        also packs a decent zoom lens, which is a necessity when shooting video.  \n  \n[Read
